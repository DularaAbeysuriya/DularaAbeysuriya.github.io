        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Dulara Abeysuriya AKA <em>'Dee A'</em>. I'm an interactive media design student at Algonquin college. I was born in 1999 March 5 <sup> th</sup> in Sri Lanka. I was an Artist + Sportsman during my school time. Making sports related content was my passsion from a small age, which made me do many experiment projects and master the digital art skills just by watching Youtube videos and trying those stuff on my own. That passion drived me to choose IMD at Algonquin college, I hope to gain more knowledge form college and make a creative impact in the <abbr title="User Experience / User Interface">UX/UI</abbr> Design feild in the future. I really like NBA legend Kobe Bryant's Mamba Mentality Listning to his Podcasts/ Videos gives me Goosebumps. I Personally Love his quote; <blockquote>"Dedication makes dreams come true."<cite>Kobe Bryant</cite> </blockquote>

            I was working as a Pro Graphic designer based in Melbourne Australia for almost 2 years at a socila media agency.I got the chance to lead the team of designers and my team was really good and helpful.Also being accountable for my teams actions is also a highlight. This rare mix of productivity and ambition sets a great example for the rest of the team as well. My mastery of core role and extra projects have been critical to the company's growth. In fact, I took on other tasks such as website aesthetics, design elements, commercials, etc. has helped us to broaden our scope.I have demonstrated my ability to work in a team environment and also being able to work autonomously during Covid period and my attention to detail is second to none according to my <abbr title="Cheif Execetive Officer">CEO.</abbr>
